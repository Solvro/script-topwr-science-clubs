This script is a versatile tool designed to scrape data from the official website of the Wroc≈Çaw University of Science
and Technology's student department. Additionally, it retrieves data from the API of the student council's website,
combines this information, and sends it to the Directus platform used by [ToPWR](https://github.com/Solvro/mobile-topwr).
